# ✊ Rock, Paper, Scissors

This interactive game uses **Markov Chains** to try to predict your next move based on your past choices.  
It's a fun demo of how simple predictive models can adapt to human patterns.
🧠 Will the AI outsmart you, or will you break the pattern?

## 🌟 Future Improvements

Some enhancements that could elevate this project and demonstrate more advanced machine learning techniques:
- 🧠 **Switch to a probabilistic model like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression** to predict the next move based on encoded player history.
- 🔄 **Implement model selection or ensemble strategies**, combining multiple prediction methods (Markov + ML) and choosing the best in real time.
- 📊 **Feature engineering from player sequences**, including frequency of transitions, reaction time (if tracked), and preferred move cycles.
- 🧮 **Train a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to model sequential dependencies in player behavior.
- 🗃️ **Persist historical player data** for training a model that adapts across multiple sessions or users.
These improvements would enable deeper exploration into behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, and adaptive gameplay using ML.
